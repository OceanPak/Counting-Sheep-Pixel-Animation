# Counting Sheep Sprite Animation
This is my final project for our Year 11 MYP CS course.  

### Description
The idea was to create a product to fit the user's preferences. My user just stated he wanted a peaceful animation, so I took a creative twist to it, and made a "Counting Sheep" animation. I took the chance to learn animating with Sprites in Java, as well as looking into UI/UX functionalities.
